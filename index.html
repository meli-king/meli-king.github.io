                <h5>Started August 2022 | Utilizes HTML, CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to apply the HTML and CSS skills I self-learned over the summer to 
                    build my own website.
                    This website is also a good way to compile all my past projects and record information about them, such as
                    language used, concepts applied and lessons learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on continuing to update this wesbite in various ways such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding a "read more" section for each project entry for more detailed information on the project</li>
                        <li>Improving site layout to be more accessible on other devices</li>
                        <li>Adding graphics to improve UI experience</li>
                        <li>Using javascript to imbed some of the projects to the webpage</li>

                <h3>RISC-V Unit Tester</h3>
                <h5>May 2022 - August 2022 | Utilizes Java, JUnit, Assembly (RISC-V and MIPS)</h5>
                <p>
                    Together with a group of three other students working under Professor Andrew Petersen, we created a program to test
                    student submitted assembly code automatically. Based off of MIPSUnit, a unit testing framework for MIPS assembly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned how to simulators work, how to work with a large, preexisting repository of code, and how to effectively 
                    communicate with multiple people as a team.

                <h3>Linux Shell Program</h3>
                <h5>January 2022 - April 2022 | Utilizes C, Python, pytest</h5>
                <p>
                    A C program containing most of the basic functionality of a shell like Bash. This shell can handle simple
                    commands like <i>echo</i> and variable declaration, while also being able to chain commands via pipes and send signals 
                    and text to other shell instances. Python and pytest was used to test the correctness of the shell.
                    <!-- A program built with C to imitate a Bash shell program. This shell program can imitate basic commands like echo
                    while also being able to use sockets to send messages across multiple instances of shells.
                    The purpose of this project is to learn about shell behaviours and system calls to the point where (I) can develop my
                    own shell that can perform the same behaviour. To test the functionality, Python was used. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned about the behaviour of a shell, how use system calls and how to build a large project from the ground up.

                <p>
                    In this, I learned how to code in assembly, use system calls and utilize functions that control external devices.

                    using Java, and a GUI made with JavaFX. Development of this game involved the use of UML and Scrum Methodologies.

                <p>
                    In this, I learned about UML diagrams, Scrum Methodologies, and how to collaborate with new people effectively.
