                <h5>Started August 2022 | Utilizes HTML, CSS</h5>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to apply the HTML and CSS skills I self-learned over the summer to 
                    build my own website.
                    This website is also a good way to compile all my past projects and record information about them, such as
                    language used, concepts applied and lessons learned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I plan on continuing to update this wesbite in various ways such as
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding a "read more" section for each project entry for more detailed information on the project</li>
                        <li>Improving site layout to be more accessible on other devices</li>
                        <li>Adding graphics to improve UI experience</li>

                <h3>RISC-V Unit Tester</h3>
                <h5>May 2022 - August 2022 | Utilizes Java, JUnit, Assembly (RISC-V and MIPS)</h5>
                <p>
                    Together with a group of three other students working under Professor Andrew Petersen, we created a program to test
                    student submitted assembly code automatically. Based off of MIPSUnit, a unit testing framework for MIPS assembly. 
                    The goal of the tester was to provide an easier way for the teaching staff of the <i>Computer Architecture</i> course to test student code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned how to simulators work, how to work with a large, preexisting repository of code, and how to effectively 
                    communicate with multiple people as a team.

                <h3>Linux Shell Program</h3>
                <h5>January 2022 - April 2022 | Utilizes C, Python, pytest</h5>
                <p>
                    A C program containing most of the basic functionality of a shell like Bash. This shell can handle simple
                    commands like <i>echo</i> and variable declaration, while also being able to chain commands via pipes and send signals 
                    and text to other shell instances. Python and pytest was used to test the correctness of the shell.
                    The goal of this shell was to utilize and apply knowledge about system calls in a practical application.
                    <!-- A program built with C to imitate a Bash shell program. This shell program can imitate basic commands like echo
                    while also being able to use sockets to send messages across multiple instances of shells.
                    The purpose of this project is to learn about shell behaviours and system calls to the point where (I) can develop my
                    own shell that can perform the same behaviour. To test the functionality, Python was used. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned about the behaviour of a shell, how use system calls and how to build a large project from the ground up.

                <p>
                    The original game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)">Simon</a>, but made entirely in assembly. The player must input a button sequence identical 
                    to the order and colour the buttons were originally flashed. As the player progresses, the speed and the amount of colours in the sequence increases. The game ends
                    when the player fails to provide a correct sequence of colours. The goal of this game was to learn how to write assembly code and utilize the heap using system calls.
                    UI provided through Ripes, a visual computer architecture simulator and assembly code editor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned how to code in assembly, use system calls and utilize functions that control external devices.

                <p>
                    Together with a group of three other students, we recreated the classic game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Musketeers_(game)">The Three Musketeers</a>
                    using Java, and a GUI made with JavaFX. Development of this game involved the use of UML, Git flow and Scrum Methodologies. The main goal of the group project was to learn
                    how to collaborate in a group similar to a real world setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned about UML diagrams, Scrum Methodologies, and how to collaborate with new people effectively.

                <h3>Image Compression Algorithm</h3>
                <h5> March 2021 | Utilizes Python, Object Oriented Programming</h5>
                <p>
                    A program that can take a given image and produce a corresponding jpeg file of the same image but at a lower quality. 
                    <!-- The program will take the average value of a group of pixels and use this value in creating the new jpeg file. -->
                    Conversely, the program can also take a compressed image and expand it back to the original image. The goal of this compressor was to apply
                    concepts of object oriented design and practice recusrion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned how to utilize object oriented design, recursion and file IO.

                <h3>GUI Interactive Tutorial for Computer Hardware</h3>
                <h5> January 2020 | Utilizes Java, Processing3, JavaScript, P5</h5>
                <p>
                    In a group with two other students, we created a program that would introduce and teach students about computer hardware components. 
                    The program GUI was provided by Processing3 and consisted of three parts:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A brief lesson, showing an image of each component and the purpose of it</li>
                    <li>A drag and drop portion, where the students can "build" a PC by dragging and dropping the components into an empty case</li>
                    <li>A quiz, where students can test their knowledge and see how much they learned</li>
                  </ol>
                <p>
                    Additionally, a teacher asked me to remake the project in P5 (Processing5) which uses JavaScript instead of Java. The goal was to imbed the P5 project into the course website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned the basics of object oriented design, how to work in a small group and some JavaScript.

                <h5> June 2019 | Utilizes Java, Processing3</h5>
                <p>
                    A simple game where the player controls a speedboat and must avoid incoming obstacles in the water as they race the waves. 
                    As the player progresses, the speed of the speedboat increases and the frequency of obstacles increases. Once the boat collides 
                    with an obstacle, the game ends and the player is given a score.
                    The goal of the project is to apply all programming concepts learned so far and program a simple game using Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this, I learned about arrays, programming in more modular ways, and working with multiple sprites.
